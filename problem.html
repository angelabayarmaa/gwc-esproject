  Over the last 150 years, anthropogenic actions led to the current global warming, or climate change. Most of these anthropogenic actions consists of, burning fossil fuels which is used for electricity, heat, transportation, etc. These actions generate <b>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</b>.
<br>
    Greenhouse gases, are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere. So in order to prevent and tackle global warming/climate change, we as a society need to replace the sources of greenhouse gas emissions with a sustainable, eco-friendly alternatives.

      <h3 id="minit"> <b>Long-Term Effects</b></h3>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p3> Most of the greenhouse gas emissions consists of Carbon Dioxide, or Co2, accounting for about 76% of all greenhouse gas emissions. And since Co2 will stay in the atmosphere for <b>300-1000 years</b>, long-term solutions to tackle global warming, is to reduce the emission of carbon dioxide. </p3>

    <div class="ppste"> 
      <h3 id="mini"> <b>Short-Term Effects</b></h3>
      <br>
      <p4> Right behind Co2, Methane (CH4) is the second most contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for about 16-30%. Methane exposure, is responsible for 1 Million premature deaths every year. Although methane accounts for less than carbon dioxide, <b>methane is 25 times more potent at trapping heat in the atmosphere</b>. This means that over a 10 to 20-year period, itâ€™s 80% more potent at warming than carbon dioxide. 

Therefore, a short-term solution for global warming, is to reduce the emission of methane.</p4>
